# Clay Studio Landing Page

This repository contains a simple static landing page for a clay studio. It consists of two files:

- **index.html**: the main HTML page written in Hebrew, designed for right‑to‑left reading. It includes a hero section, information about the studio, a section for workshops, a WhatsApp contact button, and a footer.
- **styles.css**: basic styling to give the page a warm, earthy feel inspired by terracotta and natural tones.

## How to deploy with GitHub Pages

1. After uploading these files to your repository on GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages**.
2. In the **Source** section, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Select the **main** branch and the **/ (root)** folder, then click **Save**.
4. GitHub will build and publish your site. It will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

## Custom domain

If you have a custom domain (e.g., `example.com`), you can configure it by adding a `CNAME` file to your repository containing your domain, then pointing your DNS records to GitHub Pages. For detailed instructions, see GitHub’s documentation on custom domains.

## Customizing

Feel free to edit the text and styles in these files to better match your studio’s brand. You can add images by saving them in your repository and referring to them in the HTML or CSS.
